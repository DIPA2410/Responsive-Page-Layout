Create a Responsive Page Layout

1) Create an HTML file that includes the following components:
A header section with a navigation menu.
A main content area.
A sidebar with a list of items.
A footer section.

Apply the following CSS techniques to achieve the layout:

2) Utilize the box model to control spacing, padding, and margins around elements.
Use the display property to control the layout of elements (e.g., block, inline, flex, grid).
Position elements appropriately (e.g., relative, absolute).
Use Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive navigation menu.
Use Grid layout to structure the main content area and sidebar.
Make sure the page layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

3) You can use media queries to adjust styles for different screen widths.
The navigation menu should collapse into a mobile-friendly version when the screen is narrow.

5) Add some sample content to each section for a more realistic look.
